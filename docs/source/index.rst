TORCHFITTER
=============
`torchfitter` is a simple library to ease the training of PyTorch models. It 
features a class called `Trainer` that includes the basic functionality to fit 
models in a Keras-like style.

The library also provides a callbacks API that can be used to interact with
the model during the training process, as well as a set of basic regularization
procedures.
